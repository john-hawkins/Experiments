# THIS SHELL SCRIPT CAPTURES THE FINAL ORDER OF SCRIPTS RUN TO PRODUCE THE RESULT
# NOTE: SOME OF THE ODDITY IS DUE TO WORKING AROUND MEMORY LIMITATIONS
#

# WE JOIN THE TRAINING AND TEST SUPPLEMENT DATA TO GENERATE 
# LOOK UP TABLES FOR CLICK ACTIVITY ACROSS TIME
Rscript --vanilla GENERATE_LOOKUPS.R

#
# WE THEN CREATE THE LOGG ODDS TABLE ON A SUBSET OF TRAINING DATA
# AND WE SAVE THE SET TO BE USED FOR ML MODELS 
Rscript --vanilla GENERATE_LOGODDS_TABLE.R

# NOW LOAD THE DATA FOR TRAINING AND ENCODE IT AND SAVE TO DISK
Rscript --vanilla ENCODE_DATA.R

# DO THE SAME WITH THE TEST DATA SET
Rscript --vanilla ENCODE_TEST.R 
 
# NOW BUILD MODELS
